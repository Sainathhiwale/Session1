### Spring Boot Session 1
Add Dependency 
1. Spring Web: Spring Web is a module in the Spring Framework that provides a set of features for building web applications.Build web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Apache Tomcat as the default embedded container. It includes support for:

- HTTP requests and responses: Spring Web provides a way to handle HTTP requests and responses, including support for HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), request and response bodies, and HTTP headers.
- Request mapping: Spring Web allows you to map HTTP requests to specific controller methods using annotations such as @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping.
- View resolution: Spring Web provides a way to resolve views, which are responsible for rendering the response to the client.
- Internationalization and localization: Spring Web provides support for internationalization and localization, including support for multiple languages and locales.
2. Lombok : Lombok is a Java library that automatically plugs into your compiler (Eclipse, Maven, Gradle, Ant, etc.) and allows you to reduce boilerplate code in your Java classes.

In a Spring Boot application, Lombok is often used to simplify the creation of Java classes by automatically generating:

- Getters and setters: Lombok can generate getters and setters for your class fields, eliminating the need to write them manually.
- Constructors: Lombok can generate constructors for your class, including constructors with parameters.
  ToString, Equals, and HashCode methods: Lombok can generate these methods for your class, which are often required for proper object comparison and hashing.

To use Lombok in a Spring Boot application, you need to add the Lombok dependency to your project. For example, in a Maven project, you would add the following dependency to your pom.xml file:
